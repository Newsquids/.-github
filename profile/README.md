<h1>Newsquids</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
&nbsp Our project is a website that shows financial news from traditional sources like Reuters and CNBC, as well as cryptocurrency news from sources like Coindesk. We used Next.js and TypeScript for the front-end, and Django and PostgreQL with Docker for the back-end. The website has a concept inspired by the Windows 98 interface and is currently being tested and deployed at https://www.newsqudis.co.kr.(now shut down)

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>

Front-end: Next.js, TypeScript<br/>
Back-end: Django, PostgreSQL, Docker<br/>
Deployment: GCP

<h3>Key Features</h3>
&nbsp Our service's core function is to provide users with curated financial news articles from traditional sources such as Reuters and CNBC, as well as cryptocurrency news from sources like Coindesk. Due to copyright restrictions, we are unable to crawl and display full articles. Instead, we carefully select and redirect users to relevant news articles.
